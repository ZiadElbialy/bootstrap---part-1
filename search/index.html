                <td>
                    Tailwind CSS follows a utility-first approach, allowing
                    developers to apply small utility classes directly in HTML
                    for a modular and customizable styling process.
                </td>
                <td>
                    Bootstrap is a component-based framework that includes
                    predefined components with pre-styled elements. It also
                    incorporates utility classes for quick styling.

                <td>
                    Tailwind CSS requires Node.js and npm for setup, and

                </td>
                <td>
                    Bootstrap can be set up using npm, but it also works with a
                    simple CDN link, offering flexibility in how it is
                    incorporated into projects.

                    Tailwind CSS is highly customizable, enabling fine-grained

                    to their needs, making them suitable for projects requiring
                    a unique design.
                </td>
                <td>
                    Bootstrap is customizable, but achieving highly unique
                    designs may require more effort as developers work within
                    the framework’s predefined components.

                <td>
                    Tailwind CSS has a steeper learning curve due to the
                    utility-first approach, where developers need to get
                    accustomed to using utility classes directly in HTML.
                </td>
                <td>
